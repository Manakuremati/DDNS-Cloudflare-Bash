# DDNS Cloudflare Bash Script for OpenWRT

## Requirements

- curl
- bash
- Cloudflare [api-token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) with ZONE-DNS-EDIT Permissions
- DNS Record must be pre created (api-token should only edit dns records)

### Creating Cloudflare API Token

To create a CloudFlare API token for your DNS zone go to [https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens][cloudflare-api-token-url] and follow these steps:

1. Click Create Token
2. Select Create Custom Token
3. Provide the token a name, for example, `example.com-dns-zone-readonly`
4. Grant the token the following permissions:
   - Zone - DNS - Edit
5. Set the zone resources to:
   - Include - Specific Zone - `example.com`
6. Complete the wizard and use the generated token at the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` variable for the container
